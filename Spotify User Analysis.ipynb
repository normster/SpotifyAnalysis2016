    "We see here some interesting results from our test. In every context except 'me', premium users play nearly twice as many songs. Since every play command must be either explicitly or implicitly issued, ie song plays are conscious decisions by users, we look at the largest absolute increases, that of songs played from playlists and collections. \n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that these categories increased the most suggest that they are driving factors in why users subscribe, which confirms the design philosophy behind the free version of Spotify- to reduce the functionality and accessiblity of the best parts of the premium product (the feeling of \"owning\" every song and album that Spotify serves and the power and privilege of playing any song at will) to the point where users feel frustrated and powerless, which they can remedy by purchasing a subscription.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also interesting is the trend seen in songs played from the 'me' context. Whereas free user usage of the 'me' context vary wildly (evidence by a large standard deviation), premium usage of the 'me' context plummets to virtual disuse. This pattern of behavior suggests that free users are using the 'me' context to emulate the premium product. Whereas a premium user can explicitly select single songs to play, if a free user wishes to listen to a particular song, they must play the album containing the song, the artist page containing the song, or a playlist containing the song. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the cost of waiting on an album or artist page for a specfic song to play is very high. Often the random shuffling imposed on free users will lead the user on a wild goose chase through skits, intros, or unwanted remixes, whereas a free user can pack a playlist with only songs the free user truly enjoys in order to maximize the average utility when the client shuffles to the next random song.\n",
    "\n",
    "Playlists in essence return some control over song choice to the user, and the 'me' context, which can and often is used as a pseudo-playlist, scales poorly and so is disregarded by the premium users. In conclusion, we find that playlists are a very important driver of premium subscriptions, which makes a case for focusing engineering efforts to ensure that playlist usability and functionality is always optimal."

    "Some clear trends appear in our regression model. Most obviously, we see that as confirmed above, premium users listen to significantly more music than free users. Gender seems to have little to no correlation with amount of music listened to, and age (measured in years) has a very slight negative correlation. As log account age increases, music listening does too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at our per-nation trends, we see that Curacao, Russia, Zimbabwe, Puerto Rico, and Nicaragua are the 5 most positively correlated countries. We see that Unknown, India, Iceland, Malawi, and Cyprus are the most negatively correlated countries.\n",

    "\n",
    "Our model predicts that a premium user will in the span of half a month, listen to 118 more songs than a premium user. That gives us 2832 more streams in a year, or about \\$20 more worth of songs. Since Spotify charges \\$60 to \\$120 a year for premium, even if we estimate ad revenue per free user per year at half a membership, premium users are still much more lucrative for Spotify.\n",

    "## Concluding remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "To test whether male and female listeners listen to statistically significant different amounts of music, I chose to perform Welch's t test, as opposed to Student's t test, which assumes equal variances between the populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test whether premium and free users listen to music differently, I performed Welch's t test 7 times, one for each context, because I assumed that the number of songs played between different contexts is independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "To model usage based on demographic data, because I simultaneously modeled based on nationality and the other demographic data, I did not throw out samples from countries which had few users, even though said samples were likely to be unrepresentative of their countries, because those users still had useful gender, age, and account age data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a word on limitations of my exploration and further approaches I would take with more time, data, and experience. Due to how primitive the data captured was (small set of users and short time frame of song data), I found it intractable to explore more interesting questions I had. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given a larger dataset over a longer duration of time, I would have liked to model user behavior leading up to the purchase of a subscription. Do listening patterns change significantly in the immediate song plays before a user caves to a premium subscription? If so, perhaps we can then apply this behavioral model to the general population and target more susceptible users to Spotify premium advertisements.\n",
    "\n",
    "I did not come up a method of segmenting a user's song plays into listening sessions, but if I did that would lend itself very naturally to a measure of which users are the most engaged. If we see a user play entire songs from only one context, say a 500 length playlist, this suggests the user is less engaged and perhaps leaves Spotify on to provide background noise. \n",
    "\n",
    "However if a user is actively skipping, around selecting songs from various contexts, then we can say this user is more engaged and is spending more time interacting with the actual UI of Spotify's apps. This user is likely to be more opinionated about the design of the app, and should have their client included in the next round of beta-testing. Also, more engaged users should be worth more to advertisers, which ought to factor into Spotify's advertising fee structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, with a much larger dataset of listening habits from around the world, perhaps we see some segment of users are playing much more music than everyone else. Then we might want to audit the individual listening habits of the most prolific users for fraud or other abuse of the system."
